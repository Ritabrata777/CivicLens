## Core Features:

- Issue Submission: Users can submit issues (potholes, etc.) with photos/videos, text, and location (auto-detect or manual).

- Profile and History: Users can view their submitted issues and their status.
- Admin Dashboard: Admin can view submitted issues in a dashboard and mark them as 'Seen' or 'Accepted'.
- Blockchain Transaction Trigger: Upon admin 'Accept', a blockchain transaction is triggered, storing Post ID, timestamp, admin ID, and status.
- Transparent Public View: Public can view issue status (seen/not seen), blockchain proof link, and current progress.
- Real-Time Notifications: Users receive notifications when an admin has seen their report, the report is accepted, or there are updates on progress.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and stability.

- Accent color: A muted violet (#7E57C2) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, chosen for its neutral, objective, and modern appearance that offers excellent readability.

- Clean, card-based layout for displaying issues on both user and admin interfaces.
- Subtle transitions for status updates and notifications.
